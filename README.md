# Disast-O-Detector: Disaster Detection & Management using GIS
# DESCRIPTION
Using the satellite images and implementation of various computer vision techniques such as Image feature extraction, stitching, segmentation and other GIS tools.
Creation of the maps for different disasters such as flood maps, fire mapping etc
Planning the pre-disaster things like identifying the number of construction sites and the safety measures are identified on the basis of the past data by locating on the maps, and by researching the areas where adversity is highly likely to happen.
